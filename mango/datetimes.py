# # ðŸ¥­ Datetimes
#
# Comparing datetime values in Python can lead to the following error:
#   TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes
#
# To avoid that, we use these functions to consistently create the datetime in a way
# that has the correct value and that can be compared with other datetimes generated
# by these methods.
#
# However, getting a comparable UTC time using this mechanism:
#   return datetime.utcnow().astimezone(timezone.utc)
#
# works fine on Linux and Mac but fails on Windows. So we need to avoid that method and
# be careful of different platform issues.
#
# If you use these methods to generate the datetime values, you _should_ be safe.

def local_now() -> datetime:

# Getting a comparable UTC time using this line:
#   return datetime.utcnow().astimezone(timezone.utc)
# seems to cause `OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument` on Windows (but is fine on Mac and
# Linux). Best to avoid it and use the following instead, which seems to work consistently
# on Windows as well as Mac and Linux.

# datetime that's comparable on all platforms, so we do this the same way as `utc_now()`.

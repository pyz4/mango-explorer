# # ðŸ¥­ AccountScout
#
# Required Accounts
#
# Mango Markets code expects some accounts to be present, and if they're not present some
# actions can fail.

# From [Daffy on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/791995070613159966/820390560085835786/834024719958147073):
#
# > You need an open orders account for each of the spot markets Mango. And you need a
# token account for each of the tokens.
#
# This notebook (and the `AccountScout` class) can be used to check the required accounts
# are present and maybe in future set up all the required accounts.
#
# (There's no reason not to write the code to fix problems and create any missing accounts.
# It just hasn't been done yet.)

# This is fairly nasty and unintuitive.
#
# ConsumeEvents in Serum takes in a list of OpenOrders addresses but (since it runs a binary
# search on them) they have to be sorted. Calling it in Rust uses a BTreeSet to build the
# sorted list, but it builds it from the underlying integers of the PublicKey.
#
# Every PublicKey is 32 bytes long. The 'raw' view in Rust is an array of 4 8-byte words
# expressed as integers.
#
# When the BTreeSet orders these, it uses the underlying 4 ints.
#
# So when we want to provide a sorted array to ConsumeEvents, we need to sort it the same way.

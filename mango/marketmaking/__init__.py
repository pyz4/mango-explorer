# In --strict mode, mypy complains about imports unless they're done this way.
#
# It complains 'Module has no attribute ABC' or 'Module "mango" does not explicitly export
# attribute "XYZ"; implicit reexport disabled'. We could dial that back by using the
# --implicit-reexport parameter, but let's keep things strict.
#
# Each import then *must* be of the form `from .file import X as X`. (Until/unless there's
# a better way.)

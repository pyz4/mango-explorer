# # ðŸ¥­ PairwiseElement class
#
# Some `Element`s want to process `Order`s in pairs or levels. Typically they'll have a BUY and a
# SELL at one spread, another BUY and SELL at a second spread, another BUY and SELL at a third
# spread, and so on.
#
# The 'desired orders' that come in don't fit that pattern though. It's just a list of `Order`s.
# The `Order`s may have a pair-wise structure, but it's not imposed upon them.
#
# If the `Order`s _do_ have such a pair-wise structure, some `Element`s can take advantage of that.
#
# (The assumption is that if your `Order`s _don't_ have a pair-wise structure - a matching BUY for
# each SELL - then you don't expect to successfully use `Element`s that depend upon such a
# structure.)
#
# The `PairwiseElement` handles converting from an unstructured list of `Order`s into a pair-wise
# structure, and then calls the derived class's `process_order_pair()` method to process a pair.
#

    # If multiple levels are specified, we want to process them in order.
    #
    # But 'in order' is complicated. The way it will be expected to work is:
    # * First BUY and first SELL are treated as a pair
    # * Second BUY and second SELL are treated as a pair
    # * Third BUY and third SELL are treated as a pair
    # * etc.
    # But (another but!) 'first' means closest to the top of the book to people, not necessarily
    # first in the incoming order list.
    #
    # We want to meet that expected approach, so we'll:
    # * Split the list into BUYs and SELLs
    # * Sort the two lists so closest to top-of-book is at index 0
    # * Call process_order_pair() for each paired BUY and SELL, with the index parameter being
    #   the index into the BUY and SELL lists.
